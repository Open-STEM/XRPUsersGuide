"XRPCode is a web-based development tool that is run in either the Google "
"Chrome or Microsoft Edge browsers. XRPCode can be used to create either "
"Python or Blockly language programs that run natively on the XRP control "
"board. Blockly programs are first translated to Python and then run. In "
"fact, you can view or even translate the Blockly program into a Python "
