msgid "**Effort**"

#: ../../course/driving.rst:32
msgid ""
"The effort reflects the amount of power (or average voltage) supplied to "

"flat, uphill or downhill)."

#: ../../course/driving.rst:38

"The speed is the actual number of centimeters per second that the robot "

"The following program fragments show how to program the robot to drive "
"forward for 10 centimeters with an effort of 0.5 or 50 percent power. "
"This function uses the encoders to determine when the robot has traveled "
"the requested 10cm. In addition, this function will ensure that the robot"
" drives in a straight line by varying the speed of the left or right "
"motors if one is slightly faster."

#: ../../course/driving.rst:54

"when requesting a distance to drive, the encoders are used to sense the "
"number of degrees of wheel rotation to complete the operation. If the "
"wheels slip while driving, the distance measurement will be incorrect."

"This program will set the effort on the left and right drive motors to 50"
" percent, wait for 3 seconds, and stop the motors. The set_effort() "
"function has parameters for the left and right drive motors to allow them"
" to be set independently. No motor speed control is provided, so "
"different driving surfaces, slopes, or battery voltage will affect the "
"driving speed of the robot. The value of effort ranges from -1 for 100 "

"This program will set the robot speed to 5 cm per second, in centimeters "

#: ../../course/driving.rst:97
msgid ""
"The robot can turn in place around a point directly centered between the "
"two drive wheels. This is done by driving the left and right drive motors"
" in opposite directions at the same speed. If the left wheel is spinning "
"in the forward direction, the robot will rotate clockwise or to the "
"right. If the right wheel is spinning in the forward direction, the robot"
" will rotate counterclockwise or to the left."

"The turn function specifies the number of degrees to turn, with a "
"positive number indicating a counterclockwise turn, and a negative number"

"-1 to 1."

#: ../../course/driving.rst:115
msgid ""
"When you use the turn function, the IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) gyro "
"sensor on the robot will determine when the robot has completed the "
"requested turn. This means the turn will continue until complete and is "
"not affected by wheel slip."

#: ../../course/driving.rst:127
msgid ""
"This type of turn is where one wheel moves forward, and the other is "
"stationary. The robot will pivot on the stationary wheel, making it the "
"center of rotation. The circle's diameter traveled by the moving wheel "
"will be twice the wheel track (the distance between the two wheels)."

#: ../../course/driving.rst:138
msgid ""
"Smooth turns are where the two wheels move in the same direction so that "
"the robot drives in an arc, eventually completing a full circle. The "
"circle's radius depends on the speed difference between the two wheels. "
"The larger the difference, the smaller the circle diameter."
