"The servo motor used to attach the arm on the XRP has about 200 degrees "
"of rotation and can move to a desired position using internal sensors. "
"When attaching the arm to the servo, it is important that one end of its "
"range is with the arm relatively horizontal inside the robot chassis and "
"the other end of the rotation outside the back of the robot for picking "
"up objects. The full range of arm rotation is shown in the two images "
"below."

"To position the arm correctly, install it in any position and use it to "
"rotate the servo to the full clockwise direction, as seen in the top "
"photo. Then reinstall the arm so that it is in the shown position. Then "
"the software will be able to move it to any position in between the two "
"photos above."

"Use the servo class to move the servo motor to the desired position. The "
"method set_angle() sets the servo position to the desired angle. Below is"
" an example program that moves the servo position from one end of its "
"motion to the other."

"When the servo is controlled from the program, it is held in the position"
" it was last set to. To free it, that is to allow it to be moved by hand,"
" the free() function may be called, and the program will stop sending the"
" position signal to the servo."
