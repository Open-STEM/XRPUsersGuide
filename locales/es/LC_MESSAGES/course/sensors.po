"The XRP includes an ultrasonic rangefinder that can measure the distance "
"to objects in front of it.  The sensor has two transducers; one acts as a"
" speaker, and the other acts as a microphone. It does it by sending a "
"burst of ultrasonic sound out of the speaker that hits an object in front"
" of the robot. The sound reflects off the object back to the sensor and "
"is captured by the microphone. The time for that round trip determines "
"the distance to the object. Understanding how well the sound reflects off"
" various objects of different sizes, profiles, and materials is important"
" for using the sensor. A good exercise is to test the sensor by printing "
"returned values at various distances from any object you want the robot "
"to detect."

"It is important to wire the sensor correctly, as described in the "
"assembly instructions, to ensure it works properly. Interchanging the "
"trigger and echo wires is a common error using that part."

"XRPLib has a rangefinder class that takes care of the sending and "
"receiving signals to the sensor. All the program has to do is request the"
" distance, and the library returns it. There is a single method called "
"distance() that returns the distance to the nearest object in "
"centimeters. The range of operation is from 2cm to 4m."

"This program stops the motors when the object is detected. A better way "
"of solving the same problem might be to use proportional or PID control "
"to gradually bring the robot to a stop to avoid overshoot, where inertia "
"might carry the robot beyond the 10cm set point before it comes to rest."

"A reflectance sensor that can be used for line following is included with"
" the XRP. It has two pairs of LEDs and light sensors. The LEDs emit "
"infrared light that reflects off the driving surface. The light sensor "
"measure the reflected light intensity, which depends on the surface below"
" the sensor. Electrical tape is typically used to make a line that the "
"robot can follow and has a different reflectivity than the surface, "
"usually a whiteboard or tabletop. With a pair of sensors, the robot can "
"read the reflectance value and tell where it is relative to the taped "
"line."

"The class reflectance has methods get_right() to retrieve the right "
