Wall Following
==============
Now that you've developed a program to keep a certain distance from an object, let's implement this by having the XRP follow a wall while maintaining a target distance.

Building a control law
----------------------
What do we want to do when we are too close to the wall? How do we start to move closer to the wall?

Here is a sketch of the setup:

.. tip::
   Remember that you will want to incorporate a "base effort" to ensure that the robot is moving forward at all times. Let's set this to **0.5**.

   It is also important to note that the side you choose to plate your ultrasonic range finder will affect the implmentation of the control law. 

Now, implement a proportional controller given the steps that you have previously followed and the tips noted above. 

Watch this video to see what a working wall-follower looks like. Good luck implementing this next class!
