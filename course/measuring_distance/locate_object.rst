Locating a Nearby Object
===========================

This brings up the question: how?

The easiest way to explain the intuition behind this process is sonar. 

The robot will essentially spin in a circle and take a reading at each angle.

Then, when an object is detected to be within a certain distance, the robot will stop spinning and go towards the objcet. 

This is a very simple way to locate an object, but it is also very effective (and will be especially helpful during your final project). 

Here is a video of the robot locating a nearby object:
