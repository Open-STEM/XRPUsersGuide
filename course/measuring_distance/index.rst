Module Overview 
===================================

In this module students will:

* Understand the basics of measuring distance and its application
* Learn to use distance sensors to determine the robot's location with respect to the target.
* Use reading from the sensor to avoid obstacles or stop before the object
* Learn the concept and basic application of On/Off control and Proportional Control
* Write a quick program for Robot Wall Follow

At the end of this module, students will be able to:

* Determine the robot's current position with respect to the target
* Get their robot to stop before the mark or avoid obstacles using sensors
* Use Proportional Feedback Control to control the robot's speed and achieve more accurate results.
* Develop an autonomous wall-following program
