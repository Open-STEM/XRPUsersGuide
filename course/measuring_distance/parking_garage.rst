Parking Garage Challenge! (Bonus Activity)
===========================================

Now that we've covered how to avoid obstacles and locate nearby objects, let's now try and "park" our XRP's 

The Process
~~~~~~~~~~~

The main process we will employ here is simple: 

1.  Go forward the length of a parking spot 
2.  Turn 90 degrees right and check to see if the parking spot is open
3.  If the parking spot is open, go forward and then park 
4.  If the parking spot is not open, turn 180 degrees left and check to see if the parking spot on the left is open
5.  If both parking spots are not open, turn 90 degrees right and repeat this list of steps

This is the exact same process that your parents take when they are trying to find a parking spot at the mall.

By breaking this complicated problem down into a series of smaller steps, we can easily program our XRP to park itself!
