Module Overview
===============

In this module students will:

* Learn how to make the robot drive at different speeds
* Understand the relationship between the wheel speeds and the robot's motion
* Be introduced to motor encoders and how to use them to measure the robot's movements
* Learn about the built in driving functions which help make complicated motions easy


At the end of this module, students will be able to...

* Make the robot drive in straight lines, turn corners, and turn in place
* Write and use basic functions in the Python programming language
* Use different types of loops in Python
* Break down a large, repetitive movement sequence into components and then convert into code
