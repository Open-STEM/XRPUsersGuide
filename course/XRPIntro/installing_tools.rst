Installing the programming tools
================================

Two primary programming tools will be used in this course:

Blockly
-------

This is a drag-and-drop graphical programming system similar to Scratch. Blockly is a
good choice for programming the robot, especially for learners with little to no
programming experience.  Does not easily scale for larger programs and is only
usable within the Blockly programming environment.

Installing Blockly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In a browser, navigate to the github repository release page for XRP-blockly:

https://github.com/Open-STEM/xrp-blockly/releases/

Find the most recent release - as of this writing is v0.0.5. and download the version
for the computer platform you are using. The file names below are for version 0.0.4,
be sure to take the newest release version that is posted.

Windows
  XRP.Blockly.Setup.0.0.4.exe
MacOS
  XRP.Blockly-0.0.4.dmg
Linux
  XRP-Blockly_0.0.4_amd64.deb

After downloading the release file, double-click on it to begin the installation. Follow
all the instructions
taking all the default settings unless you have a reason to change one of them. When it
is finished, you
may delete the release file. To start using Blockly, find it in the Start Menu on
Windows or the Applications on a Mac.


Python
------

A more widely-used language that scales well for larger programs and works with professional
programming tools such as Visual Studio Code and many others. The tool that will be used
throughout this course for python programming is Mu Editor, although a more professional
tool such as Visual Studio Code can also be used for writing CircuitPython code that is
used by the XPR Robot.

.. Note::

   A way to get students comfortable with programming more quickly is to start with
   Blockly getting through basic concepts such as functions, conditionals, loops,
   and all the basic robot operations. Then move to Python to complete the course,
   especially for some more complex challenges, such as the final project.
   This will allow for quick onboarding without having to learn too many new
   concepts at the same time. But the decision will depend on the level and experience
   of the students taking the course.

Installing Mu Editor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mu is a simple and concise editor that allows us to edit our CircuitPython code, and view
serial output from our robot. To install, go to the following
webpage: https://codewith.mu/en/download

Download the file corresponding to your operating system, and then open the downloaded file
and follow the installation prompts that are provided.

Mu allows you to run different implementations of Python for different microcontrollers.
In our case, we want to run CircuitPython, which is compatible with our Maker Pi RP2040.
Select the “Mode” button shown below.

Select CircuitPython and confirm by clicking ‘OK’.

In the Mu Editor, you may notice a symbol of a red ‘x’ on a microchip in the bottom right
corner of the window.

This indicates that Mu has not detected a robot device attached to the computer.
In order to write and download programs to the robot, you’ll need to connect your computer
to the robot via a Micro-USB cable. **Connect the robot and turn it on using the switch
near the back of the robot chassis.**

.. note::

   Some micro USB cables are only designed to carry power. The one provided in your kit
   will carry the power and data which is required for programming your robot.

At the bottom right corner of the screen, the red "chip" icon will now be grey,
indicating a successful connection between the robot and the computer running Mu Editor.

At this point, you can upload and run programs to the robot written in the main window.

Additional resources about using Mu Editor for programming your robot can be found
