Course Overview
===============
This course is designed to teach the knowledge and skills 
necessary for a basic understanding of programming for 
your XRP robot using either the Python or Blockly programming 
languages. The intent of this course is that it is interactive, 
and we expect you will work on every intermediate challenge. 
At the end there is a final project challenge requiring all 
the skills that are taught in the modules leading up to it. 
Each module builds on the previous by adding new robotics and 
programming concepts. New programming techniques are introduced 
to solve concrete robot problems, not as abstract unattached 
learning. This way students will see the relevance and need 
for each concept introduced. 

The modules are outlined in the syllabus along with the 
learning objectives associated with each one. There are 
also short quizzes throughout the course to help students 
make sure they are learning the important concepts.

The course can be run with one robot per student or with 
teams of a few students working on each robot. Working in 
teams allows students to help each other as they work 
through the course. But one student must not be doing all 
the work, preventing the other team members from learning 
the material.
